## Overall

First off, I don't know anything about robotics. This is my first foray into this game. If you're just starting like me, I hope these notes provide a step-by-step process for learning this stuff for the first time.

# My process

1. Order all the parts from Sammy.pl/combobreaker
2. Arduino Software (arduino.cc)


## Ordering the Parts

This is all easy via Sammy's link (Sammy.pl/combobreaker) the parts look like this once they arrive and are parsed down to what is needed:

## Learning to Program Arduino

First off, I'd like to run a simple program to ensure I'm able to successfully write code to the microcontroller.

I found this tutorial useful for making the first move:

This helped me overcome initial steps like setting the serial port, selecting the right device and more.
